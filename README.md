## Problem Statement


The problem we aim to address with our web3 crowdfunding website is the lack of trust and transparency in traditional crowdfunding platforms. These platforms often suffer from issues such as high fees, delayed payments, and centralized control, which can discourage both donors and fundraisers from participating.

Moreover, traditional crowdfunding platforms often require participants to use fiat currencies, which can be subject to government regulations and fluctuations in value. This can limit the accessibility of crowdfunding to people in certain regions or with certain financial backgrounds.

By leveraging the power of blockchain technology and the thirdweb framework, our platform offers a solution to these issues. We aim to create a transparent and decentralized platform that allows for secure and borderless transactions, as well as low fees and fast payouts. Our goal is to empower individuals and organizations around the world to raise funds for their projects, ideas, and causes, without the limitations and risks associated with traditional crowdfunding platforms.


## Objectives


- To create a decentralized crowdfunding platform that operates on the web3 ecosystem, providing a secure and transparent way for people to raise funds for their projects and causes.

- To leverage the power of blockchain technology and smart contracts to ensure trust and transparency in every transaction, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of fraud and corruption.

- To enable donors to make contributions using various cryptocurrencies, providing them with a borderless and accessible way to support projects and causes from around the world.

- To reduce transaction fees and eliminate delays in payment processing, ensuring that fundraisers receive their funds quickly and efficiently.

- To provide users with a user-friendly interface that simplifies the crowdfunding process, making it easy for fundraisers to create and manage their campaigns, and for donors to contribute to them.

- To foster a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about supporting innovative ideas and social causes, and to provide them with a platform to connect and collaborate.

- To continuously improve and innovate the platform, based on user feedback and emerging trends in the web3 ecosystem, to ensure that our web3 crowdfunding website remains at the forefront of decentralized crowdfunding technology.


## Methodology


- `Smart Contract Creation`: Solidity was used to create a smart contract that facilitates executing agreements. This smart contract was then deployed and managed on the blockchain using the Thirdweb Framework. The use of smart contracts provides transparency and autonomy, which is a key feature of the platform.

- `Front-End Development`: Once the smart contract was deployed, the development of the front-end was started using ReactJS framework and Tailwind CSS for styling. Different hooks such as useState, useContext, and useLocation were used to implement various functionalities in the front-end.

- `Backend Connectivity`: After the front-end was created, the logic for connecting it with the smart contract was implemented. Functions like publishing campaigns, getting campaigns, and getting user campaigns were created to provide users with the ability to view campaigns published by the user. This backend connectivity ensures that the front-end and smart contract are seamlessly integrated, enabling users to use the platform effectively.

- `Real-time Updates`: The web site provides real-time updates on the amount donated, the amount yet to be raised, and the donors. This is achieved by using technologies like web sockets, which enable the front-end to receive data in real-time without the need for constant refreshing.

- `Testing and Deployment`: The entire platform was tested thoroughly to ensure that it was functioning as intended. Once testing was complete, the platform was deployed on a web server for users to access it.


## Results

The results of the project were successful in achieving the objectives set out in the project description. The web-based platform that uses smart contracts for executing agreements provides transparency and autonomy, enabling users to create and donate to campaigns for various causes. Here are some of the results of the project:

`User-Friendly Interface`: The platform has a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. Users can create campaigns, donate to campaigns, and view campaigns published by other users with ease.

`Seamless Integration`: The integration between the front-end and the smart contract is seamless, enabling users to use the platform effectively.

`Real-Time Updates`: The platform provides real-time updates on the amount donated, the amount yet to be raised, and the donors, making it easy for users to track the progress of their campaigns.

`Secure Transactions`: Transactions on the platform are secure and transparent, ensuring that the funds are used for the intended cause.

`Scalability`: The use of the Thirdweb Framework and ReactJS enables the platform to scale effectively, ensuring that it can handle a large number of users and campaigns.

`Positive Impact`: The platform has the potential to make a positive impact on the world by enabling users to raise funds for various causes and execute agreements with transparency and autonomy.
